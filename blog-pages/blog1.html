            9 TIPS ON WRITING IN AN ENGAGING STYLE
        </h2>
        <h5 style="font-family: lato;">
            by Jesse Berman | Feb 21, 2019

        <h5>
            It’s commonly believed that being an effective writer mostly requires a proper grasp of correct spelling, punctuation, and
            the ability to organize ideas clearly. While these are essential elements, they are not enough to truly stand
            out from the crowd. To be memorable, your writing needs to be more than understandable; it needs to be enjoyable.
            The reader must feel compelled to keep reading; not because they have to, but because they want to. To help explain
            this, we’ve put together a short list of quick tips that will help you to truly expand your potential as a writer.
        </h5>
        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            1. Vary Your Words
        </h3>
        <h5>
            To begin, it is normally for the best to show off your command of language and extensive vocabulary. A writer who knows four
            or five synonyms for a single word, and uses each of them, will often be assumed to be more educated and intelligent
            than someone who repeats the same words again and again and again. Rather than saying “the boats,” three or four
            times in the same paragraph, say “the boats,” “the fleet,” and “the flotilla” at different points.
        </h5>
        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            2. Avoid Sentences That Are Too Long
        </h3>
        <h5>
            More often than not, the longer a sentence is the more difficult it will be for a reader to understand. In general, you will
            want to vary your sentence length a bit, while keeping the majority of your sentences between one to three lines
            in length (or, in terms of word count, below sixty or seventy words). Doing so will go a long way towards avoiding
            unnecessary exhaustion for the reader.
        </h5>
        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            3. Minimize Sentences That Are Particularly Short
        </h3>
        <h5>
            At the same time, sentences that are too short can also be problematic. If most of your sentences are just three or four
            words long, your writing may be viewed as amateurish, or even infantile. If you want a reader to view you as
            an adult, be sure to include more than a few sentences between fifteen and twenty-five words. One caveat: none
            of this should be meant to suggest that short sentences are never acceptable. In fact, after a lengthy sentence
            of three or four lines, a single word with a period after it might be more impactful than anything else. What’s
            most important to remember is that almost anything, including both short and long sentences, can become dull
            or irritating if overused. Be sure to vary the length of your sentences, and use your best judgement in deciding
            how to vary them.
        </h5>
        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            4. Use Tricks Like Alliteration And Rhymes
        </h3>
        <h5>
            Let’s be honest for a moment: reading can be boring, particularly in a world with so many visual and electronic distractions
            available to us. That is why it is often the job of writers to make their words entertaining, in order to capture
            and keep the reader’s interest all the way to the end.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            One such way is to match up words with similar sounds, such as with alliteration. Alliteration is a technique that involves
            stringing together several words that all begin with a similar consonant. “Peter Piper” would be an example of
            alliteration, as would be “Dunkin Donuts.”
        </h5>
        <h5>
            A more familiar trick, though, might be the simple rhyme. While perhaps most commonly associated with music and poetry, rhymes
            are more than acceptable in everyday prose.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            “The pirate was shouting and cursing and threatening to make them walk the plank.”
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Just like with alliteration, rhymes help to give energy to the language and keep the reader reading.
        </h5>
        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            5. Experiment With Plays On Words And Alterations Of Common Idioms
        </h3>
        <h5>
            A great way to show off your writing talent is to make clever little twists on common English phrases and idioms. For example,
            one common idiom is “to add insult to injury.” Now, most people have heard this idiom a hundred times over, which
            makes it stale and boring, so let’s try to liven it up a bit. Suppose that there is a courtroom where a witness
            is testifying under oath, and, in addition to lying about a defendant committing a crime, the witness also calls
            the defendant stupid. In such a situation, one could say that the witness “added insult to perjury,” which takes
            the original phrase and replaces “injury” with a word that rhymes, altering the meaning to more specifically
            apply to the particular situation.
        </h5>
        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            6. Try Using Antimetabole
        </h3>
        <h5 style="display: inline;">
            This technique may be rather advanced, but can be a great way to display creativity through your words. An
        </h5>
        <h5 style="display: inline;">
            <a style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;" href="https://literarydevices.net/antimetabole/">
                “antimetabole”
            </a>
        </h5>
        <h5 style="display: inline;">
            is a phrase that gets repeated in reverse order. Some prominent examples include the following:
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                “The first shall come last and the last shall come first” – The New Testament

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                “Fair is foul and foul is fair” – Shakespeare
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                “The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack” – Kipling
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                “I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne”
                – George R.R. Martin
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>
            Antimetaboles are viewed as effective for their logic and their ease of remembrance. If the first half is viewed by the reader
            as true, then they will be more likely to accept the other half as true. While conjuring new ones out of thin
            air can be quite difficult, doing so will showcase your talent.
        </h5>

        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            7. When Creating Metaphors, Use Older Imagery
        </h3>
        <h5>
            A metaphor is generally defined as a word or phrase that refers to something, such as an object, action, or abstract concept,
            in a non-literal manner. Examples might include “the hailstones stabbed at my face like daggers,” or “neither
            she nor her forked tongue could be trusted.”
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Metaphors can take many forms and involve any number of things. However, while you are of course free to use any type of
            metaphor you wish in your writing, I personally tend to follow what I like to refer to as “the grandfather rule.”
            In essence, “the grandfather rule” means this: if the imagery you wish to use involves something that didn’t
            exist in your grandfather’s day, or previous to your grandfather’s day, then steer clear. Things found in nature,
            like forests and rivers, and older technology, like shovels, streets, and arrows, would be perfectly fine to
            use for a metaphor. Newer technology, though, such as things invented after the 1930s or 40s, can feel lacking
            in authenticity.
        </h5>

        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            8. Use The Right Tone For The Situation
        </h3>
        <h5>
            A critical part of effective writing is recognizing who your audience is, and how to shape your message to appeal specifically
            to them. Creating the right tone is a crucial aspect of this. “Tone” often has to do with the emotional state
            that the writer is expressing, whether consciously or otherwise. Tones can be happy, angry, sad, excited, fearful,
            aggressive, emotionally vacant, or just about anything else under the sun.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Let’s look at a few examples:
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                “Oh my god, it would be so amazing if you could come to my birthday party! I would jump for joy if you were there!”

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                “Um, excuse me, but I’d like to invite you, if you wouldn’t mind, to my birthday party. I’m sorry if you already have plans
                that day; please don’t be mad at me . . .”
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                “YOU ARE GOING TO COME TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY, AND YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE IT, OR ELSE!!!”
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>
            All of these are essentially inviting someone to a birthday party, but in very different ways. One is excited and happy,
            the second is fearful, and the third is angry and possibly violent.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            What type of tone do you want to use? It will be up to you to determine what tone is best for the situation you happen to
            be in, and the audience you are trying to communicate with.
        </h5>
        <h3 class="blog-window-subheading">
            9. Read
        </h3>
        <h5>
            Practicing writing is a great way to get better at it, but without anything to compare your writing to you may have difficulty
            evaluating how much you are improving. As such, it is helpful to read, on an ongoing basis, what others are writing,
            and to borrow from their ideas and techniques to bolster your own skill level.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            At this point, many who offer similar advice would likely focus on the titans of literature, such as Hemingway, Austen, Twain,
            and, of course, Shakespeare. However, while these are of course excellent sources from which to get inspiration
            for your writing, there are also any number of alternatives. Professional newspapers will get you comfortable
            with the basics, such as good grammar, as will some of the better blog postings that the web has to offer.
